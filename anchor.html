			<h2> playing style </h2>
			<p> Kohli is a naturally aggressive batsman[39] with strong technical skills.[291] He usually bats at the no.3 position in ODI cricket.[292] He bats with a slightly open-chested stance[293][294] and a strong bottom-hand grip,[295][296] and is said to have quick footwork.[297] He is known for his wide range of shots, ability to pace an innings and batting under pressure.[298][299][300] He is strong through the mid-wicket and cover region.[301] He has said that the cover drive is his favourite shot, while also saying that the flick shot comes naturally to him.[21] He does not play the sweep shot often, being called "not a natural sweeper of the cricket ball".[302] His teammates have praised his confidence, commitment, focus and work ethics.[303][304][305] Kohli is also known to be a "sharp" fielder.[306][307]

"He is a consummate surgeon at the crease, intensely focused, working hard, playing the ball into gaps in the field and staying calm under pressure. He is always judging the right time to consolidate and the right time to seize a game by the scruff of the neck."
— Former South Africa captain AB de Villiers on Kohli[308]Kohli is regarded as the best limited-overs batsmen in the world, especially while chasing.[309][310] In ODIs, he averages around 69 in matches batting second as opposed to around 51 batting first.[311] 26 of his 43 ODI hundreds have come in run-chases and he holds the record for most hundreds batting second.[312] Regarding his impressive record batting second, Kohli has said "I love the whole situation that comes with chasing. I like the challenge of testing myself, figuring out how to rotate strike, when to hit a boundary."[21] Kohli is often compared to Sachin Tendulkar, due to their similar styles of batting, and sometimes referred to as Tendulkar's "successor".[163][172] Many former cricketers expect Kohli to break Tendulkar's batting records.[313][314] Kohli has stated that growing up his idol and role model was Tendulkar and that as a kid he "tried to copy the shots [Tendulkar] played and hit sixes the way he used to hit them."[315] Former West Indies great Vivian Richards, who is regarded as the most destructive batsman in cricket, stated that Kohli reminds him of himself.[147] In early 2015, Richards said Kohli was "already legendary" in the ODI format,[316] while former Australian cricketer Dean Jones called Kohli the "new king of world cricket".[317]

“The way my personality and character is, I am the representation of new India.”

Kohli is noted for his on-field aggression and was described in the media as "brash" and "arrogant" during his early career.[305][319] He has got into confrontations with players and umpires on several occasions.[305][320] While many former cricketers have backed his aggressive attitude,[321][322][323] some have criticised it.[305][324] In 2012, Kohli had stated that he tries to limit his aggressive behaviour but "the build-up and the pressure or the special occasions make it tough to control the aggression."[325] In September 2018, West Indies legend Brian Lara, who was in New York as a part of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 Trophy Tour, picked Kohli as one of the best batsmen in the world, alongside England captain Joe Root.<p>

			<h2> endrosements </h2>
			<p>Kohli was signed up by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after the 2008 Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh recalls, "I didn’t go after them after they became stars. In fact, I watched Virat at the 2008 ICC Under-19 World Cup in Kuala Lumpur. I was mighty impressed with his attitude and the way he was marshalling his team. He had that spark. And I told Yuvi to set up the meeting."[360] Sajdeh manages Kohli's endorsement deals, along with those of other Indian cricketers Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Murali Vijay. It was reported in 2013 that Kohli's brand endorsements were worth over ₹1 billion (US$14 million).[361] His bat deal with MRF is said to be the costliest deal in Indian cricket history.[360] In 2017, he signed an eight-year endorsement deal with Puma worth about ₹1.1 billion (US$15 million), becoming the first Indian sportsperson to sign a ₹1 billion (US$14 million) deal with a brand.[362]
In 2014, American Appraisal estimated Kohli's brand value at US$56.4 million placing him fourth on the list of India's most valued celebrity brands.[363] The same year, UK-based magazine SportsPro rated Kohli as the second most marketable athlete in the world behind only Lewis Hamilton, placing him above the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Usain Bolt.[364] In an October 2016 report by Duff & Phelps on India's most valued celebrity brands, Kohli's brand value was estimated to be US$92 million, second only to that of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.[365]
In 2017, Kohli was ranked 7th in the list released by Forbes as the Most Valuable Brand among athletes, ahead of sportspeople like Lionel Messi, Rory McIlroy and Stephen Curry, with an estimated brand value of $14.5 million.[366] In 2018, Kohli was again listed 83 in the top 100 highest paid athletes in the world. In 2019, Kohli dropped 17 places to No. 100 on Forbes' World's 100 Highest-Paid Athletes" list, making him the only Indian and the only cricketer to feature in that list. His earnings were estimated at about $25 million, earning $21 million from endorsements and the rest from salary and winnings.<p>
